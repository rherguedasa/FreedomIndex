In this project, we have analyzed the most important macroeconomic variables shown in this study. In addition, we have compared 3 types of regressions (Lasso, Ridge and Linear) to create a predictive model that will give us as a result the 2022 index. After finalizing the model we compared the predicted results with the actual values for 2022.
